  ## Common Signs for Maintenance


  Even if your heating system seems to be running smoothly, there are signs that it may need maintenance to prevent future problems. One of the most common indicators is if your system has started making unusual noises, such as rattling, banging, or whistling, which can signal worn or loose components. If you notice that your home isn’t heating as evenly as it used to or if your energy bills are creeping up without a corresponding increase in usage, these could be signs that your system is due for a tune-up. Regular maintenance helps catch these issues early, ensuring your system continues to run efficiently.
