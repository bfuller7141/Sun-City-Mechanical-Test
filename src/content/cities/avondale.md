We’re proud to serve the Buckeye community. At Sun City Mechanical, family isn’t just a word; it’s the heart of everything we do. Started by Gary Ferguson and now led by his niece, Jenni, we’ve always believed in treating our customers like family. When you choose us, you can expect the same warmth, care, and dedication that we’d offer our own.

In Buckeye, we understand the importance of keeping your home comfortable throughout the year. Whether it’s keeping cool in the summer or staying warm in the winter, our team is here to ensure your home feels just right. With us, you’re not just getting a service—you’re getting a family that’s always here to help.
